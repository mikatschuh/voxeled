Only one triangle of each face renders.

Cause:
    The points of the triangles have the wrong indices.

Solution:
    Correct the indices.

Random faces have the wrong orientation.

Cause:
    The Instances are recognized with the wrong size and alignment
    issues show up.

Solution:
    Enter the correct size.

Only Faces that point in on direction render.

Cause:
    The GPU is not synchronizing properly.

Solution:
    Use a different buffer everytime you write to the GPU to force
    it to synchronize.

Pixels are rendered on top of other ones even though they are behind.

Cause:
    The resolution of the Z-Buffer is too small.

Solution:
    Increase the near plane as that will add resolution to the rest.
