Only one triangle of each face renders.

Cause:
    The points of the triangles have the wrong indices.

Solution:
    Correct the indices.

Random faces have the wrong orientation.

Cause:
    The Instances are recognized with the wrong size and alignment
    issues show up.

Solution:
    Enter the correct size.

Only Faces that point in one direction render.

Cause:
    The GPU is not synchronizing properly.

Solution:
    Use a different buffer everytime you write to the GPU to force
    it to synchronize.

Pixels are rendered on top of other ones even though they are behind.

Cause:
    The resolution of the Z-Buffer is too small.

Solution:
    Increase the near plane as that will add resolution to the rest.

Inputs are buggy.

Cause:
    The inputs were not kept from the last frame.

Solution:
    Build a system that doesnt get reset and subtracts the processed time from the total downtime.

Textures were rotated

Cause:
    The texture coordinates were wrong

Solution:
    Correct them in the shader

Between LOD-Levels there were holes

Cause:
    The frustum generator was throughing away overlapping LODs in a way that created holes

Solution:
    Through away the smaller LODs, because thats way easier

Faces in a certain direction are missing.

Cause:
    CPU Backface Culling exludes faces based on chunk coordinates,
    but doesnt consider the chunk expansion

Between LOD-Levels the mesh has holes

Cause:
    The larger LODs exclude faces because their same-LOD neighbors have blocks at these places,
    though when lower LOD chunks are rendered next to them holes are created
